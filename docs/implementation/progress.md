2026-10-03, Asia/Taipei. Working local P0 slice; not the complete Rocky product.

| Task        | Status      | Actual result                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| T-001       | done        | Independent Git root and local commit, original engineering files, Apache-2.0, workspace, new CI and reference decisions. Remote uncreated.         |
| T-002       | blocked     | Locked dependencies, installed license inventory and Windows clean-copy no-Python validation. Ubuntu evidence unavailable.                          |
| T-003       | in_progress | Real CopilotKit gateway → Work → native Deep Agents task/todos/interrupt → stdio/HTTP MCP. Functional browser flow verified; upstream P0 gate open. |
| T-004       | blocked     | Four Promptfoo full-path cases and Node egress pass with blocked SDK telemetry recorded. Browser egress fails from host AdGuard injection.          |
| Later tasks | pending     | No claims for later product capabilities or original Bot art.                                                                                       |

Node 24.12.0 / npm 11.6.4 baseline. No upstream code, history, data, settings or assets imported. All test data synthetic. No remote action or live paid endpoint used. See known-limitations.md for gates and follow-up.

Evidence: [verification](evidence/2026-10-03/verification.json), [dependency baseline](dependency-baseline.json), [acceptance matrix](acceptance-report.md). All 70 global acceptance entries remain not_run; phase checks do not imply full acceptance.
